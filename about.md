# Hi there!

I'm a Software Engineer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. My career has given me many opportunities to work with a vast array of technologies my  personal passion has always been databases.

This site is a chance for me to document my learnings as I embark upon learning as much as I can about SQL Server. It's a bonus if others find it of any use.
